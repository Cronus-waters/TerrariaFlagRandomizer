The Terraria Flag Randomizer attempts to change up the Terraria experience, by shuffling several progression flags around the game.
Will you find Hardmode by defeating the Eye of Cthulhu, or perhaps defeat the Pumpkin Moon to gain access to the Dungeon? Every seed can have different results.

Current features:
[list]
[*]Major progression flags (Skeletron, Hardmode, Mechanical bosses, Plantera, and Golem) are removed form their respective bosses and shuffled around as rewards
[*]Randomization is based on the world seed
[*]Progressive loot bags, which reward items based on your progress in the randomizer
[*]Rewards can end up on any of the bosses, or a few minibosses
[*]The world is tweaked so that both Corruption and Crimson, as well as their biome-exclusive enemies, are present
[*]Tweaks and logic should ensure that every seed is beatable
[/list]

Planned features:
[list]
[*]More checks (including invasion events, Town NPCs, and other major areas)
[*]Chestsanity Mode (Rewards can be distributed into random chests across the world)
[*]Traps (Some checks might have a chance to give a negative, or funny, effect)
[*]Better logic, allowing more distinct seeds
[*]Plandomizer??
[*]And possibly more...
[/list]
