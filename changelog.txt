New features:
	Added a new generator option: Progressive Flags (turn it on in the mod settings before generating a world)
		- Progressive flags turns the major world-altering flags (in this version, all of them) into a Progressive Flag reward
		- The Progressive Flag reward gives you the next flag you're supposed to get, in the order of vanilla progression (so you'll always get Skeletron first, then Hardmode, etc)
		- Old seeds are still compatible with this version, and work as if Progressive Flags was turned off
	Added proper sprites for all loot bags

Fixes/Adjustments:
	Adjusted the requirements for some bosses, to allow for a more smooth experience:
		- Skeletron Prime's check now requires Skeletron to be defeated, due to the requirement of Bones for crafting the Mechanical Skull.
